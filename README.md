# Attack of the Front End Web Developer!
#### A practice in Svelte and SvelteKit.
##### LIVE LINK: https://framework-practice.vercel.app/
This site was created for three major reasons:
- To learn Svelte and Sveltekit
- To see how much I can learn in put together in as short amount of time as possible
- To learn how to use Photoshop to edit and composite images

I spent about two days putting this together, learning the basics of Svelte and how Sveltekit handles code as well as learning how to use Photoshop to create the images for the story.

I hope you enjoy!
